## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our authentication system seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### Reporting Process

1. **Email**: Send your findings to security@example.com
2. **Encryption**: Use our PGP key for sensitive details (available at our security page)
3. **Response Time**: We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
4. **Updates**: We will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix
5. **Recognition**: We're happy to credit security researchers who report valid vulnerabilities

### What to Include

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

## Security Update Process

1. The security team will confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
2. The team will audit code to find any similar problems
3. We will prepare fixes for all supported versions
4. We will release security fixes as soon as possible

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**
   - All code changes must go through security review
   - Use static analysis tools
   - Follow secure coding guidelines

2. **Authentication**
   - Always use secure session management
   - Implement proper password hashing
   - Enable 2FA where possible

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Use prepared statements for database queries
   - Sanitize all user input

### For System Administrators

1. **Server Configuration**
   - Keep all software up to date
   - Use secure TLS configuration
   - Enable security headers
   - Regular security audits

2. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor for suspicious activities
   - Set up alerting for security events
   - Regular log review

3. **Backup & Recovery**
   - Regular backups
   - Tested recovery procedures
   - Incident response plan
